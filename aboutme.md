    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>In 2023, I graduated with distinction from the University of Ottawa, earning a B.A.Sc. in Biomedical Mechanical Engineering and a B.Sc. in Computer Technology. Subsequently, I commenced my M.A.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering within the Clinical Biomechanics Research Unit at the same university. My research primarily concentrates on understanding the mechanisms behind ACL injuries and ruptures in sports, specifically their rehabilitation in the youth population, an area that is often inadequately addressed in current studies.
    </p>
    <p>Interestingly, in most case pediatric treatment for biomechanical disorders typically adapts adult protocols with minor adjustments to suit younger patients, of which is why my primary research motivation is to explore innovative ways to integrate my passion for sports—specifically football (soccer)—with engineering to foster a healthier youth society.

<!-- I recently completed my B.A.Sc (Biomedical Mechanical Engineering) as well as my B.Sc (Computer Technology) in 2023 with distinction at the University of Ottawa and have since start my M.A.Sc (Biomedical Engineering) part of the Clinical Biomechanic Research Unit at the University of Ottawa primarly focusing on Sport injury knee mechanism and rehabilation specifically in the youth population which is much oten overlooked.

Did you know that in most case pediatric treatment for various biomechanical illnesses is just a copy of the adult treatment but slightly modifying to fit the youth in question.What drives my main research focus is finding ways to merge my passion for sport (primarly football (European)) and Engineering for a helthier society of which is why my current -->
